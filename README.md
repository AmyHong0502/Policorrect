## Acknowledgments

* Policorrect won the first place at UBC Local Hack Day 2017. 
* The theme for the day was "Inclusivity, Diversity & Accessibility".
* Policorrect supports social minorities such as women, disabled people, and LGBTQIA community.
* Your language makes you. Everyone might use inappropriate words sometimes, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the speaker is a mean person. Maybe they don't know alternatives, or they don't even know the word they use is actually not a proper word.
* Policorrect helps these cases in two ways: chatbot to easy and quick search and a full list of words for more details and studying.
